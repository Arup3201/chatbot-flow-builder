## Screens

![Screen with some nodes](./screens/screen1.png)

![Screen with panel settings](./screens/screen2.png)

![Can't save flow](./screens/screen3.png)

Todo:
1. Replace alerts with toasts
2. After clicking on a node, when I click outside of it - settings panel should close
3. Delete a node by pressing `Delete`
4. Delete an edge by pressing `Delete`
5. Data type need to be more dynamic to allow future addition of different nodes

Bugs:
1. Drop position is not correct
2. Consecutive selection of different nodes does not change the settings panel content sometimes
